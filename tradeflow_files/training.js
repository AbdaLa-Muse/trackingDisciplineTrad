{topic:"Risk Management",q:"What is the maximum weekly drawdown allowed by the system?",a:["-3%","-4%","-5%","-6%"],correct:2,why:"The weekly maximum drawdown is -5%."},
{topic:"Risk Management",q:"You are up 4% for the week. Can you increase normal trade risk to 1.5%?",a:["Yes, because you have a profit cushion","Yes, only for A+ setups","No, the fixed-risk model does not allow it","Yes, but only on Friday"],correct:2,why:"Risk is not increased or reduced because of weekly performance."},
{topic:"Risk Management",q:"On the special-risk day, what is the maximum total risk allowed?",a:["1%","1.5%","2%","3%"],correct:2,why:"One day per week may carry up to 2% total risk."},

Is this allowed?",a:["Yes, the combined risk is 2%","No, each trade must risk exactly 1%","No, two positions are never allowed","Yes, but only if both are on the same pair"],correct:0,why:"The 2% exposure can be one trade or multiple simultaneous positions, as long as combined risk does not exceed 2%."},
{topic:"Risk Management",q:"How is the special-risk day selected?",a:["It is fixed by the broker","It must always be Monday","You choose it based on market conditions","It must follow a winning day"],correct:2,why:"The special-risk day is selected at your discretion based on market conditions."},

What should you do?",a:["Take it because the weekly limit has not been reached yet","Take it if the setup is A+","Do not take it because full risk could push the week beyond -5%","Take it with a tighter stop"],correct:2,why:"No trade may be taken if its full risk could push weekly drawdown beyond -5%."},

What does the weekly-protection rule say?",a:["It may be taken because a full loss would bring the week to exactly -5.0%","It is never allowed below -4%","Risk must be increased to 1%","It automatically becomes the special-risk day"],correct:0,why:"The rule prevents trades that could push drawdown beyond -5%.

// 3. DURING TRADE — 10

Can you widen the stop?",a:["Yes, to give the trade more room","No, the planned stop should remain unchanged","Yes, if you dislike taking the loss","Yes, if you also move the target"],correct:1,why:"The stop loss was planned in advance and should not be changed because of emotion."},
